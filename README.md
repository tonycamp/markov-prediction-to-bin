# markov-prediction-to-bin
this markov exe file to bin
makes any file of less than 10Mb into
a bin file of 3x more the size
seems usseless but if you recompress with emma lea or paq8px or cmix
you get less 0.5% of the original size
not total recompresion in recursive but its markov prediction
you may check bmx code in  blitz max
reverse engine to be done .. help wanted
